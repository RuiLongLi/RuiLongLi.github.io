Hi! I'm Ruilong(Tom), an graduate student majored in applied economics & economic and social policy in The Chinese University of Hong Kong(CUHK) and Northwestern University. Besides learning in social science, I have just enough expertise in computer science and data science to make trouble. 


My Background and History
======
I received my BS in Economics and Finance from Xi'an Jiaotong Liverpool University.


Research Interest 
======
I am currently looking for a funded Ph.D position in social psychology, applied economics.
